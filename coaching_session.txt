Following steps: 
	- rejecting outliers of the dataset (to improve the logistic regression)
	- selecting more features (only to increase f1, should be somewhat methodologic)
	- playing with the regularization and decision boundary params (in a for loop, all results of testing 		should be saved for the final paper)
	- implementing SVM (also from the assignments, compare it to logistic regression)
	- comparing results with models from SKLearn
