# ML_stroke_prediction
Project for the Master's in Engineering Technology Course of Machine Learning at University Hasselt &amp; KU Leuven

### The dataset used for this stroke prediction model can be found on skaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

### Collaborators:
- https://github.com/DivadGe
- https://github.com/VerbruggenD

### Applied functions
The course is largely based on the old Coursera course tought by Andrew Ng, with the rewritten assignments in python.
We have to use at least one implementation from those assignments as the learning model, this code will be denoted like this.

```
